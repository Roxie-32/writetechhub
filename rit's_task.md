# DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A USER MANUAL AND A USER GUIDE

## USER MANUAL
A user manual is a document that provides instructions, information, and guidance on how to use a product or system. 
It is a comprehensive reference tool for users, providing detailed explanations, step-by-step procedures, and illustrations to help them understand and operate the product effectively.

User manuals usually cover a wide range of topics related to the product, like the following:

1. Installation: Instructions on how to set up and install the product, including any required software or hardware.

This includes details on the controls, buttons, menus, and interfaces, as well as explanations of any unique modes or settings.
3. Maintenance: Guidance on how to properly care for and maintain the product to ensure its optimal performance and longevity. 
This may include instructions on cleaning, storage, and routine maintenance procedures.
4. Troubleshooting: Troubleshooting tips and solutions for common issues or problems that users may encounter. 
User manuals often provide a troubleshooting section that helps users identify and resolve issues independently before seeking further assistance.
5. Safety precautions: Important safety instructions and warnings to ensure the user’s well-being and prevent accidents and damage. 
This section may cover topics such as electrical safety, handling of hazardous materials, and precautions related to the product’s usage environment.

A user guide is a document that provides instructions, guidance, and information on how to use a specific feature, function, or task of a product.

It is usually more focused and concise than a user manual, providing quick and easy reference for users who need specific instructions related to a particular aspect of the product.


## USER GUIDE
